# SecondOrderGUI
MATLAB gui for examining behavior of second order systems

This MATLAB gui is designed to help learn/demonstrate how values of &omega;<sub>0</sub> and &zeta; effect the behavior of second order systems with respect to the pole-zero plot, the step response, the impulse response, and the Bode plot.  Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass and Band Reject (Notch) filters can be explored.
